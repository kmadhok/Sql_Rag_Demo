  "rewritten_query": "How to perform table unions and join operations using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, CROSS JOIN, NATURAL JOIN, INNER INTERSECT, OUTER UNION, and FULL OUTER JOIN on tables such as Customers and Orders, including examples of establishing relationships between these entities for enhanced data retrieval in SQL?\n\nEnhanced Query Examples:\n1. Inner Join Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id\n   FROM Customers\n   INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;\n   ```\n\n2. Left Join Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id\n   FROM Customers\n   LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;\n   ```\n\n3. Cross Join Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM Customers CROSS JOIN Orders O;\n   ```\n\n4. Natural Join Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM Customers NATURAL JOIN Orders;\n   ```\n\n5. INNER INTERSECT Example (for intersecting two sets):\n   ```sql\n   SELECT customer_id, order_id\n   FROM Orders\n   WHERE condition1\n   INTERSECT\n   SELECT customer_id, order_id\n   FROM Orders\n   WHERE condition2;\n   ```\n\n6. Outer Union Example (for combining results of two queries):\n   ```sql\n   (SELECT * FROM Customers) UNION ALL\n   (SELECT * FROM OrderDetails);\n   ```\n\n7. Full Outer Join Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT Customers.customer_name, Orders.order_id\n   FROM Customers\n   FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;\n   ```",
