Include advanced ranking with window functions like `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()` over a partition, often using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subquery. Query must filter results for a specific date range, like the last 30 days, using a `WHERE` clause with date functions (`DATE_SUB`, `CURRENT_DATE`, `GETDATE()`, `INTERVAL`, `BETWEEN`). Demonstrate `JOIN`s (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) between tables like `products`, `orders`, and `order_details` to link product information with transactional data.
